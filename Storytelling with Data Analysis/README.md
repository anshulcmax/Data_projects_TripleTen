## 📁 Project Overview

This project involves performing a deep data visualization analysis using Tableau on a fictional superstore dataset. The goal is to extract actionable business insights by exploring patterns of profitability, advertising opportunities, and return behaviors.

## 🎯 Objectives

The project is divided into three main parts:

---

### **Part 1: Profits & Losses**

1. **Identify Key Profit & Loss Centers**
   - Determine the two most profitable and two least profitable combinations of dimensions (e.g., Subcategory + Region).
   - Visualize and justify conclusions.

2. **Identify Products to Stop Selling**
   - Pinpoint products that consistently incur losses.
   - Justify via clear visual evidence.

3. **Subcategory Focus**
   - Recommend 3 subcategories to focus on and 3 to stop selling.
   - Support with comparative visualizations.

---

### **Part 2: Advertising Strategy**

1. **Ad Targeting by State & Month**
   - Identify the 3 best combinations of states and months to advertise in.
   - Visualize average profit per unit sold and determine how much to spend on advertising using a 1/5 profit rule.
   - Use Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) logic to support conclusions.

---

### **Part 3: Return Behavior**

1. **LEFT JOIN with Returns Table**
   - Integrate the `Returns` table using a LEFT JOIN on `Orders`.
   - Convert `Returned` field into a calculated binary field (`Yes` = 1, `null` = 0).

2. **Return Rate Analysis**
   - Visualize:
     - Products with the highest return rate.
     - Customers with the highest return rate.

3. **Profit vs Return Rate**
   - Create a combined chart comparing average profit and return rate by a dimension of your choice.
   - Argue whether the superstore should continue operating in this dimension.
