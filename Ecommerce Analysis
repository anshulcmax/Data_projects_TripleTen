## 🧠 Project Goals
Analyze user behavior and transactions on an e-commerce platform using raw event logs. Key objectives include:
- Building a conversion funnel to evaluate user drop-off
- Creating acquisition cohorts based on first purchase month
- Calculating monthly cohort retention rates

---

## 🛠️ Steps & Sheets Breakdown

### Part 1: Build a Conversion Funnel
- **Sheet:** `conversion_funnel`
- Source: `raw_user_activity`
- Method: Pivot table with 3 funnel stages (e.g. product_view → add_to_cart → purchase)
- Metrics: Unique user counts, step-to-step and total conversion rates

---

### Part 2: Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis
- **Sheet:** `purchase_activity`
- Filter only `purchase` events
- Row count after filter: **4,845**

#### Calculate First Purchase Date
- **Sheet:** `first_purchase`
- Method: Pivot table to get minimum `event_date` per `user_id`

#### Add Date Columns
- **In `purchase_activity`**:
  - `event_month` using `TEXT(event_date, "YYYY-MM")`
  - `first_purchase_month` using `TEXT(first_purchase_date, "YYYY-MM")`
  - `cohort_age` using `DATEDIF(first_purchase_date, event_date, "M")`

---

### Part 3: Calculate Retention Rates
- **Sheet:** `cohort_analysis`
- Group by `first_purchase_month` (cohorts)
- Columns: unique user counts per `cohort_age`

- **Sheet:** `retention_rates`
  - Cohort size in Age 0 column
  - Formula: Retention rate = Age X / Age 0

---

## 📄 Executive Summary

### 🔍 Results
- Summarized key metrics:
  - Funnel drop-off rates
  - Retention rates across 0–4 months

### 🧾 Analysis
- Dataset: Raw logs of user events (views, carts, purchases)
- Methods:
  - Funnel: Based on unique user counts
  - Cohorts: Based on first purchase month
- Assumptions: Only purchase events used in retention; months in `YYYY-MM` format

---

## 🧼 Final Touches
- Reordered sheets for clarity: `Table of Contents`, `Executive Summary`, results, then calculations
- Applied formatting: headers bolded, freeze panes, clean formulas
