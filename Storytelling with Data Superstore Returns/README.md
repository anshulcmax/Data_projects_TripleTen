# 📊 Storytelling with Data: Superstore Returns Analysis

This project explores the high volume of returned orders at a fictional Superstore and provides a data-driven narrative to help stakeholders understand *why* returns occur and *how* to reduce them. Built using Tableau, this analysis emphasizes the power of data storytelling to uncover insights and guide business decisions.

## 🧩 Objective

Prepare an interactive Tableau dashboard and story presentation to answer:
> **What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore?**

The goal is to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance to identify the root causes of returns and recommend actionable solutions for reducing them.

## 📁 Dataset

- [`Superstore.xls`](./Superstore.xls)  
A historical dataset that includes orders, returns, products, customers, regions, and sales.

## 🔍 Analysis Breakdown

### 1. Identifying Return Patterns
- Created a calculated field to flag returns (1 = "Yes", 0 = null).
- Analyzed return rates across various dimensions:
  - 📉 **Scatterplot**: Total Sales vs. Total Returns by Product Subcategory
  - 📦 **Bar Chart**: Return Rate by Product Category
  - 🧍 **Customer Analysis**: Frequent returners, filtered by customer order count
  - 🌍 **Geographic Analysis**: Return rates by state, city
  - 📆 **Time Analysis**: Return rates by month/week to observe seasonality
  - 📊 **Composite Charts**: Visualizing return rates by combined factors (date, region, category)

### 2. Dashboard Development
- Created low-fidelity wireframe sketches (3+ versions)
- Selected one mock-up to build in Tableau
- Constructed a dashboard using:
  - Interactive filters
  - Key visualizations from above
  - Summary KPIs and story highlights

### 3. Story Presentation
- Built a Tableau Story to guide viewers through the insights
- Included only **caption-based story points**
- Presentation highlights:
  - How returns are measured (rate vs. count vs. cost)
  - Root causes of returns (customer behavior, product type, geography, seasonality)
  - Walkthrough of dashboard functionality
  - Next steps & recommendations for Superstore leadership

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau Desktop
- Excel (data preprocessing)
- Pen & Paper (mock-up sketches)

## ✅ Deliverables
- Worksheets for each return analysis
- Final Tableau Dashboard
- Tableau Story (caption-only)
- 3–5 minute video walkthrough

## 📌 Outcome

This project demonstrates how combining data visualization and narrative techniques can help organizations better understand operational issues—in this case, product returns—and drive strategic improvements.
