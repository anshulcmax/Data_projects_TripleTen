# 🏙️ NYC Airbnb Spreadsheet Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores Airbnb listings in Manhattan to help a client identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for vacation rentals. The analysis provides data-driven recommendations on where to invest and estimates the potential revenue generated by top listings.

The project is completed using Google Sheets with Pivot Tables and basic data cleaning techniques.

## 🔍 Objectives

1. Identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes (number of bedrooms) for vacation rentals.
2. Estimate how much money the most attractive listings generated in the past year.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Cleaned the `neighborhood` field by removing inconsistent capitalization and spaces.
  - Output column: `neighborhood_clean`
- Cleaned the `bedrooms` field by filling empty cells with `0` (representing studio apartments).
  - Output column: `bedrooms_clean`

## 📈 Analysis Approach

### Part 1: Attractiveness Based on Reviews

- Created a pivot table grouped by `neighborhood_clean` and summarized the total `number_of_reviews_ltm` to measure listing attractiveness.
- Identified the top 10 neighborhoods with the highest review counts.
- Extracted the top 3 neighborhoods: **Lower East Side, Harlem, and Hells Kitchen**
- Analyzed the popularity of bedroom sizes using a separate pivot table on `bedrooms_clean`.

### Part 2: Revenue Estimation

- Filtered for **1-bedroom listings** in each of the top 10 neighborhoods, except Midtown (used studio apartments).
- Created a column `top_listing` to mark listings that meet the criteria.
- In the calendar dataset:
  - Added a `revenue_earned` column that multiplies `adjusted_price` by 1 if `available = "f"`, otherwise 0.
- In the listings dataset:
  - Used `SUMIF()` to sum total `revenue_earned` over 30 days.
  - Multiplied monthly revenue by 12 to estimate annual revenue.
- Built a pivot table to rank top listings by estimated annual revenue using `top_listing` as a filter.

## 📎 Files Included

- `NYC Airbnb Data`: Contains the cleaned and processed listings and calendar data.
- Pivot tables for both reviews and revenue.
- Visualizations (e.g., bar chart of top neighborhoods).

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Google Sheets
- Pivot Tables
- Conditional Formulas (`IF`, `SUMIF`)
- Bar Charts

## ✅ Results Summary

- **Top neighborhoods:** Lower East Side, Harlem, Hells Kitchen
- **Most popular property size:** 1-bedroom listings (studios for Midtown)
- **Revenue estimation:** Annual revenue calculated based on 30-day calendar and adjusted nightly prices.

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Pivot tables are powerful for quickly summarizing and comparing large datasets.
- Cleaning data consistently is critical for accurate analysis.
- Using proxies like review count can effectively estimate listing popularity in the absence of direct booking data.
